Accident Prevention with Smart Light System
Description
The Smart Street Light System enhances safety on roads with the use of sensors such as infrared or ultrasonic. When it detects objects, it finds pedestrians, animals, or automobiles and sends the signal wirelessly to the neighboring streetlights, which turn red to alert an oncoming vehicle to slow down or stop. The system would enhance real-time safety measures along roads and railway lines.
