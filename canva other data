Case Study – An Overview
Case Study:
Client: Working Professional Couple in Urban India
Challenge:
Mr. and Mrs. Iyer, both full-time IT professionals with tight schedules, found it difficult to manage precise pressure cooking during busy mornings. Overcooked or undercooked meals were common due to missed whistles, and the lack of auto shut-off led to gas wastage and safety concerns.
Solution:
The couple installed the Smart Cooker Whistle Counter with Auto Shut-Off, which accurately detects cooker whistles using sound sensors and automatically shuts off the stove after reaching the desired whistle count. It also notifies the user with a buzzer and LCD alert.
Results:
✅ Time Saved: Reduced constant monitoring and allowed multitasking during cooking.
 ✅ Convenience: Set-and-forget functionality gave peace of mind.
 ✅ Energy Efficiency: Stove shuts off at the right time, avoiding gas or electricity wastage.
 ✅ Safety: Reduced risks of food burning or stove overuse.
 ✅ Precision Cooking: Achieved perfect whistle-based recipes every time.
Conclusion:
The smart whistle counter made daily cooking stress-free and more efficient, especially during rushed mornings, empowering the couple to manage meals without compromising on quality.
